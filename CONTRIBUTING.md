## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Your Project Name Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [your-email@example.com].

## Getting Started

Contributions to [Your Project Name] are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to [Your Project Name] are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site](https://example.com).
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Coding Standards

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

1. All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
2. We follow [specific coding style guide] for [language]. Make sure your code adheres to this.
3. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
4. Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or functionality.

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. Please adhere to this format for your commit messages.

## Testing

We use [specific testing framework] for our tests. Make sure to write tests for new features and bug fixes. Run the entire test suite before submitting your pull request.

## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of this project. Please make sure to update the documentation when you make changes to the code. This includes both in-code documentation (comments) and external documentation (README, wiki, etc.).

## Community

We have a [community forum/chat] where you can ask questions, share ideas, and interact with other contributors. Feel free to join and participate in discussions!

Remember, contributions to this project should be a fun and fulfilling experience. If you're unsure about anything, just ask â€“ or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

Thank you for contributing to [Your Project Name]!
